# Project exotest
EXO nodeJS test.

* No certificates added to project, therefore project will not respond from an https address, but
for the purposes of the project, that should not be a problem.
* Committed with the project, exads.png shows a POST call from Postman to the encoder endpoint, and
the resulting response.
* Please access the app after running from: http://<yourIP>:<yourPort>/encoder, method POST with a raw body string.
